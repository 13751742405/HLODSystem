  title: Batching and simplify by group
  sections:
  - heading: What is it?
    text: ' This sample shows how to create HLODs by material to maximize visual quality.
      Also, it simplifies their mesh for the reduce polygon count. '
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: Where should watch?
    text: This sample has 3 HLOD. You should watch the HLOD component located in the
      child object of HLOD. You can see the HLOD component in there. Each node minimizes
      popping by creating a different distances that changing to sub-nodes.
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: BigObjects
    text: This object is created for big objects like landmarks. It is not used the
      HLOD component because the objects are huge and not many objects.
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: Rocks
    text: Rocks are used a specific material, that is why it has to make individual
      HLOD component.
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: Vegetation
    text: 'Vegetation is also created as a separate material and has an HLOD just
      for them. At the expense of some quality reduction, it is possible to use Standard
      to further reduce the number of batches. '
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: Standard
    text: Other objects are made into one HLOD. Since these objects do not require
      a separate material, creating them with Standard is not a problem.
